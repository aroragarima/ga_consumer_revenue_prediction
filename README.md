# ga_customer_revenue_prediction


In this Kaggle competition, the objective is to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.
